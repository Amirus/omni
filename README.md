# omni - Work in Progress

This is a prototype sample for implementing event-driven microservices in golang ([HappyPancake style](http://abdullin.com/happypancake/)). 

This is currently work-in-progress without any modules implemented (just an infrastructure for defining modules, use cases and verifying these use-cases). There are no modules implemented at the time.
